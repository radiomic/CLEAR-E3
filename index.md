## Welcome to CLEAR-E3!

CLEAR-E3 is essentially an explanation and elaboration document for CLEAR, accompanied by carefully selected examples from the literature. CLEAR-E3 is an initiative brought to you by the EuSoMII Radiomics Auditing Group, providing a valuable resource for both authors and reviewers for better reporting of radiomics research according to CLEAR. CLEAR-E3 statement can be accessed [here](https://eurradiolexp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41747-024-00471-z).

## What is CLEAR?
