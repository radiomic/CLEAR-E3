## CLEAR item#40


“Uncertainty evaluation and measures (e.g., confidence intervals). Describe the uncertainty evaluation (e.g., robustness, sensitivity analysis, calibration analysis if applicable) and measures of uncertainty quantification (e.g., confidence intervals, standard deviation).” [1] (from [the article by Kocak et al.](https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13244-023-01415-8); licensed under CC BY 4.0)


### Reporting examples for CLEAR item#40

> **Example#1.** “To assess predictive performance, we measured the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Additionally, we computed precision-recall AUC (PR AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the F1 score, the negative predictive value (NPV), and the positive predictive value (PPV). Bootstrapping with 1000 samples was performed to compute 95% confidence intervals for all the evaluation metrics.” [2] (from the article by Bodalal et al.; licensed under CC BY 4.0)

> **Example#2.** “Calibration for the prediction of tumour response to nCRT and FFDM was assessed via the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit test (HL test) and Greenwood Nam d’Agostino test (GND test), respectively.” [3] (from the article by Shahzadi et al.; licensed under CC BY 4.0)

### Explanation and elaboration of CLEAR item#40

A thorough description of uncertainty evaluation is crucial to validate the reliability of results. Robustness, sensitivity analysis, and calibration analysis serve as essential components to assess the stability and generalizability of radiomic models [4]. Measures of uncertainty quantification, such as confidence intervals and standard deviation, play a crucial role in conveying the precision and reliability of the results. Incorporating these methods into radiomics research ensures a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the results.
