## CLEAR item#10


“Study nature (e.g., retrospective, prospective). Indicate whether the study is prospective or retrospective and case/control or cohort, etc. In the case of prospective studies, provide registration details if available.” [1] (from [the article by Kocak et al.](https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13244-023-01415-8); licensed under CC BY 4.0)


### Reporting examples for CLEAR item#10

> **Example#1.** “We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 105 patients with grade II-IV astrocytomas. […] A total of 105 patients met the study criteria and were divided into a training dataset (31 December 2011 to 2 November 2015, n = 74) and a time-independent validation dataset (16 November 2015 to 21 March 2017, n = 31)” [2] (from [the article by Wei et al.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-018-5575-z); licensed under CC BY 4.0)

> **Example#2.** “This was a multicentre, prospective study. […] This multicentre study was approved by the ethics committee of the principal investigator’s hospital and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02313649).” [3] (from [the article by Wang et al.](https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2018-316204); licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0)

> **Example#3.** “We designed a retrospective case-control study that patients with ACS (n = 90) were well matched to patients with no cardiac events (n = 1496) during 3 years follow-up, then which were randomly divided into training and test datasets with a ratio of 3:1” [4] (from [the article by Shang et al.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-08109-z); licensed under CC BY 4.0)


### Explanation and elaboration of CLEAR item#10

Providing study´s nature such as retrospective (see Example#1), prospective (see Example#2), case/control (see Example#3), observational, diagnostic, or prognostic enables readers to assess the applicability of findings to their own context. Different study designs have distinct strengths and weaknesses in mitigating bias and confounding variables [5]. In prospective research, by making registration information available (see Example#2), transparency is encouraged and contributes to maintaining the trustworthiness of the evidence used to create health policies and treatment decisions.
