## CLEAR item#28


“Default configuration statement for remaining parameters. After providing all modified parameters of pre-processing and radiomic feature extraction, state clearly that all other parameters remained as a default configuration.” [1] (from [the article by Kocak et al.](https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13244-023-01415-8); licensed under CC BY 4.0)

### Explanation and elaboration of CLEAR item#28

After detailing the modified parameters for pre-processing and radiomic feature extraction, it is essential to explicitly mention that all remaining parameters were maintained at their default configuration. This statement serves as a critical point of reference, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in research methodologies. Additionally, features may show different correlation with imaging parameters, with different preprocessing techniques [4]. By specifying that default settings were preserved for all other parameters, researchers convey a standardized baseline for their study. Clarity in reporting default configurations is particularly important when utilizing complex software or algorithms for pre-processing and feature extraction. It reduces ambiguity and potential sources of variation, fostering a clearer understanding of the methods used.
