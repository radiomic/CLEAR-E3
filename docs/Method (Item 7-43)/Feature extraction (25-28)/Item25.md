## CLEAR item#25


“Feature extraction method. Indicate which software programs or tools are used for radiomic feature extraction. Specify the version of the software and the exact configuration parameters (also see Item#55). Provide reference and web link to the software. Indicate if the software adheres to the benchmarks/certification of IBSI. Specify the general feature types, such as deep features, hand-crafted features, engineered features, or a combination. Refer to the mathematical formulas of the hand-crafted and engineered features. Provide formulas and code if new hand-crafted features are introduced. Present the architectural details for deep feature extraction. Provide details of any feature engineering performed. Specify whether radiomic features are extracted in a two-dimensional (2D) plane, 2D tri-planar, or three-dimensional (3D) space. If 2D features are extracted from 3D segmentation, provide reasons (e.g., large slice thickness) as to why such an approach is followed.” [1] (from [the article by Kocak et al.](https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13244-023-01415-8); licensed under CC BY 4.0)

### Explanation and elaboration of CLEAR item#25

To make the published work searchable, the keywords must highlight its most important aspects. As Example#1 and Example#2 show, radiomics studies must clearly specify imaging modalities (MRI, CT, etc.), target conditions or pathology and anatomy, and analysis methods (machine learning, deep learning). Keywords that clearly state these characteristics help investigators find studies for their own work, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses of radiomics research.
