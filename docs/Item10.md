## CLEAR item#10


“Study nature (e.g., retrospective, prospective). Indicate whether the study is prospective or retrospective and case/control or cohort, etc. In the case of prospective studies, provide registration details if available.” [1] (from [the article by Kocak et al.](https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13244-023-01415-8); licensed under CC BY 4.0)


### Reporting examples for CLEAR item#10

> **Example#1.** “We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 105 patients with grade II-IV astrocytomas. […] A total of 105 patients met the study criteria and were divided into a training dataset (31 December 2011 to 2 November 2015, n = 74) and a time-independent validation dataset (16 November 2015 to 21 March 2017, n = 31)” [33] (from the article by Wei et al.; licensed under CC BY 4.0)

> **Example#2.** “This was a multicentre, prospective study. […] This multicentre study was approved by the ethics committee of the principal investigator’s hospital and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02313649).” [34] (from the article by Wang et al.; licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0)

> **Example#3.** “We designed a retrospective case-control study that patients with ACS (n = 90) were well matched to patients with no cardiac events (n = 1496) during 3 years follow-up, then which were randomly divided into training and test datasets with a ratio of 3:1” [35] (from the article by Shang et al.; licensed under CC BY 4.0)


### Explanation and elaboration of CLEAR item#10

Item#9 highlights the accurate description of the sample size and how the optimal sample size was determined. Radiomics studies should describe if a priori power analysis for sample size calculation was performed to determine the minimal sample to yield sufficient power for the radiomics model construction [5]. Radiomics studies with an insufficient number of cases due to the small samples, especially if divided into training and validation cohorts, can lead to unreliable model performance and lack of generalization due to overfitting due to the high number of extracted features [6]. This can be particularly problematic in radiomics studies analyzing rare diseases or conditions. A minimum number of 10–15 samples per feature in the final radiomic model has been suggested for radiomics studies, based on previous evidence on logistic regression-based modelling [7].
