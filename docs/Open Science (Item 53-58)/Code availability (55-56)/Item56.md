## CLEAR item#56


“Sharing source code for modeling. Share the modeling scripts. Code scripts should include sufficient information to replicate the presented analysis (e.g., to train and test pipeline), with all dependencies and relevant comments to easily understand and build upon the method. Even if the actual input dataset used cannot be shared, in situations where a similar dataset is available publicly, it should be used to share an example workflow with all pre- and post-processing steps included. Specify the reason in case the source code is not available.” [1] (from [the article by Kocak et al.](https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13244-023-01415-8); licensed under CC BY 4.0)

> **Example#3.** “The script of the model development and validation is available at GitHub (https://github.com/xby947/RF-Model-development.git) to improve the reproducibility of this research.” [4] (from [the article by Li et al.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-023-01477-8); licensed under CC BY 4.0)

### Explanation and elaboration of CLEAR item#56

Item #56 in the CLEAR checklist underscores the importance of sharing source code for modeling in radiomic studies. This practice is crucial for ensuring transparency, replicability, and the advancement of scientific research. The code scripts should contain sufficient details and explanatory comments to replicate the analysis. The provided examples demonstrate good practices where the authors have shared their modeling scripts via open-access repositories like GitHub. This openness allows other researchers to access and build upon the methods used, thereby facilitating the replication of results and fostering further research. However, to our knowledge, there are no papers explicitly stating why the source code is not shared when it is withheld. Additionally, there seems to be a gap in studies that use publicly available datasets to demonstrate their pipeline. Utilizing public datasets in such instances would be valuable for illustrating the workflow and ensuring that the methods are accessible and verifiable.
